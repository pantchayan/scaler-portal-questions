Write internal CSS and determine flexbox properties of the Footer.

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. footer contains:
    1.1. div.footer-parent element.
    1.2. p.footer-p element containing copyright info.
2. div.footer-parent element contains:
    2.1. ul.footer-text -> contains redirectable links
    2.2. ul.social-link -> contains social media logos inscribed in links 

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

To acheive this you need to utlise Flexbox properties in the following manner.

For div.footer-parent:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'space-between'

For ul.footer-text:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'start'

For ul.social-link:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'end'

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
