Write internal CSS and determine flexbox properties of the Contact Us form.

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. section.contact-form-section contains:
    1.1. h2 element with content 'CONTACT US'
    1.2. div.container_parent 
2. div.container_parent element contains:
    2.1. video.element
    2.2. form element

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

To acheive this you need to utlise Flexbox properties in the following manner.

For section.contact-form-section:
1. Set the display to flex
2. Set the main axis of flex as y-axis (column)
3. Align the items to center on the y-axis 

For div.container_parent:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the children elements across horizontal axis to 'space-evenly'

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
