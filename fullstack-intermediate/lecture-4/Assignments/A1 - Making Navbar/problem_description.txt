Write internal CSS and determine flexbox properties of the Navbar.

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. <header> includes <nav>
2. <nav> contains list of anchor tags linked to several sections of the webpage
Don't change any of the boilerplate code.

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

To acheive this you need to utlise Flexbox properties in the following manner.

For ul.navigation:
1. Set the display to flex
2. And position the <li> across horizontal axis to 'flex-end'

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
