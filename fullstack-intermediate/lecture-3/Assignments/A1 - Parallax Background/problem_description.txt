Writing CSS to acheive a parallax effect in the background.

What you are given?

You are provided with HTML and CSS boilerplate code, in which you have:
1. A <header> tag and a <section> tag
2. Both containing a <h2> tag
3. Height of both, header and section, is set to 100vh.

Don't change any of the boilerplate code.

What you need to do?

You need to write CSS to:
1. Set background property of header with linear gradient and color value of:
    1.1. 'linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)), lightblue'
2. Set the background-attachment property of header with the value of 'fixed'

By doing so, you would be able to achieve parallax effect on the header.
While working on your local machine you can replace the color 'lightblue' with any image url that you want to set as a background.
 
Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
The end result should be similar to the one given below:
