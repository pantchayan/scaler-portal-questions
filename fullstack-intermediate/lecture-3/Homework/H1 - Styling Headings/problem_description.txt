To achieve this, you have to write CSS as per the instructions given below.

For h2:
1. font size is set to '30px' and color is set as 'gray'
2. text transform property is utilised to make the entire heading 'uppercase'

For making the underline, we use h2::after to make content after the h2 element,
Inside which:
1. content propety is set to "" (an empty string)
2. color property is set to '#f63854'
3. display property is set to 'block'
4. border-bottom has value of solid
5. and it has a margin from top and bottom of 30px and right and left of 65px.

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
