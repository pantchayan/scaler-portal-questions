Write internal CSS to style the header of the landing page.

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. header contains:
    1.1. nav element
    1.2. div.showcase element
2. div.showcase element contains:
    2.1. 1 h1.main-heading and 1 div.btns element
3. h1.main-heading contains
    3.1. h1.main-heading contains text and span elements.

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

For div.showcase:
1. Set the display to flex
2. Set the main axis of flex as y-axis (column)
3. Align the element to center on the y-axis 

For h1.main-heading:
1. Set the display to flex
2. Set the main axis of flex as y-axis (column)

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
