Write internal CSS to make the features section responsive

You are given HTML and some preset CSS as boilerplate. 

In HTML:
1. section.features contains:
    1.1. h1 element
    1.2. div.container-parent
2. div.container-parent contains: (display set as flex)
    2.2. 3 div.containter elements that are the feature cards.

The output should look like this:

<INSERT IMAGE>

To acheive this you need to utlise media query in the following manner.

Add a media query for screens smaller than 940px, in which:
1. Using flex-direction, change the main-axis of the div.container-parent to y-axis
2. In the div.container-parent, align the items across cross-axis to center.

Note: smaller than 940px will have max-width set to 939px

Further, refer to the test cases to understand necessary requirements to submit the problem.
