Write a pollyfill of 'reduce'

You need to complete the function reduce, which recieves 2 inputs:
1. 'arr'
    1.1. An array of numbers 
2. 'reducer'
    2.1. A function that does some mathematical operation on 2 input numbers and returns the resultant.
    2.2. reducer(num1, num2) returns a resultant.

The function reduce(arr, reducer), when called, should behave in similar fashion as inbuilt Array.prototype.reduce() function in JavaScript.
Refrain from using the inbuilt Array.protoype.reduce() function in JS, trivial test case would check for that. 

Input : 
arr = [2, 3, 4, 5]
reducer = fn(a,b){ return a+b }

reduce(arr, reducer)

Output : 
14

Input : 
arr = [2, 3, 4]
reducer = fn(a,b){ return a-b }

reduce(arr, reducer)

Output : 
-5
