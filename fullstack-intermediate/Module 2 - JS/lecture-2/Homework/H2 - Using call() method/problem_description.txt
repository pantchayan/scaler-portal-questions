Problem Description:
Implement a program that utilises call() method in Javascript to make the provided function work on different objects.

Explanation:
1. You have a main function that takes in 2 parameters:
    1.1. obj -> A object with different set of values.
    1.2. func -> A simple function that utilises the values from the object provided and returns a string.

2. You need to write a program using call() method, which makes the provided function 'func' use the object 'obj' to generate a string.
3. You then need to catch the return string in the 'resultString' variable, which is then returned from the main function. 

Note: 
The value of obj and func will be totally different for all the test cases, so there is no scope of hard coding the problem.

Sample test case:

Input:
let obj = {
    name: "bucky",
    team: "Team Cap",
};
let func = function () {
    return `Hello avengers this is ${this.name} from ${this.team} lets fight !`;
};

console.log(main(obj, func))

Output:
Hello avengers this is bucky from Team Cap lets fight !
