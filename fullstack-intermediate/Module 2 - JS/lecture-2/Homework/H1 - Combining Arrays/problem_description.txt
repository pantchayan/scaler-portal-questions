Problem Description:
Complete the combineArrays() function by implementing a program in Javascript that combines two arrays into a new one.

Explanation:
1. You have a function combineArrays that takes in 3 parameters:
    1.1. arr1 -> Set of values 
    1.2. arr2 -> Set of values
    1.3. finalArr -> Empty array

2. Inside the function body, write the code to successfully combine arr1 and arr2, and put the values in the finalArr.

3. The function finally returns the combined finalArr.

4. You can utilise 'apply' method to perform the above operation.

5. Make sure the values in arr1 and arr2 aren't changed after the operation.

Sample test case:

Input:
arr1 = ["Steve" , "Falcon" , "Bucky"]
arr2 = ["Iron Man" , "Spider Man" , "Rhodey"]
finalArr = []

Output:
arr1 = ["Steve" , "Falcon" , "Bucky"]
arr2 = ["Iron Man" , "Spider Man" , "Rhodey"]
finalArr = ["Steve", "Falcon", "Bucky", "Iron Man", "Spider Man", "Rhodey"]
