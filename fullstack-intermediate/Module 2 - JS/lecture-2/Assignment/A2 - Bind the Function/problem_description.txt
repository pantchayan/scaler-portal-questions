Problem Description:
Implement bind method below 
THANOS has snapped the finger, use bind method in such a way that now iron man should be able to snap the finger again.

Meaning -> 

1. You are given boilerplate JS code with the following objects:

        const thanos = {
            name: "THANOS",
            snap: function () {
                return `${this.name} snapped the finger and half of the universe ${this.name == "THANOS" ? "disappeared" : "came back"}`;
            }
        }

        const ironman = {
            name: "IRON MAN"
        }

        console.log(thanos.snap())

2. Notice that ironman object doesn't have a snap method.
3. You need to utilise Javascript binding facility to make a binded function.
4. This function will be a bind of :
    4.1. snap function from thanos object
    4.2. and ironman object  

A variable called 'bindedFunction' has been declared in the main function.
You need to update the main function and initialise the bindedFunction, such that the main function returns this bindedFunction.
Test cases will then be evaluated in the backend.
