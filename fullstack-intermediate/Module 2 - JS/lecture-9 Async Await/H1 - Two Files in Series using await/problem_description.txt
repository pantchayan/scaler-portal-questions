Problem Description:

Using async await complete the function twoSeries(file1, file2, ansArray), 
which takes in two file names as file1 and file2 and ansArray

Write the code such that:
1. Both the files are serially read using the fetchByPromise(fileName)
2. Add the content of both files in the ansArray.
3. At the end of the contents, the ansArray should hold string "All files have been read"

Example: 

Input: 
let ansArray = [];
twoSeries('FILE 1', 'FILE 2', ansArray)';

Output: 
ansArray = ['content : FILE 1', 'content : FILE 2', 'All files have been read']
