Problem Description:

Using async await complete the function nSeries(fileArray, ansArray), 
that takes in fileArray and ansArray, in which 
fileArray is an array of file names.

Write the code such that:
1. All the files in the fileArray are serially read using the fetchByPromise(fileName)
2. Add the content of both files in the ansArray.
3. At the end of the contents, the ansArray should hold string "All files have been read"

Example: 

let ansArray = [];
let fileArray = ["FILE - 1", "FILE - 2"];
nSeries(fileArray, ansArray);

Output: 
ansArray = ['content : FILE 1', 'content : FILE 2', 'All files have been read']
