Problem Description:

Your task to write a JS program that traces the path of Queen from the checkbox that is clicked by user.

You are provided with Boilerplate HTML and CSS code, that builds a chess board on the page.

The HTML has majorly 3 types of components in the following inheritance: 
div.board > div.row > div.checkbox

Here,

1. div.board:
    1.1. contains the entire chess board
    1.2. has 8 div.row as immediate children

2. div.row:
    2.1. contains a single horizontal row in the chessboard
    2.2. there are a total of 8 div.row 
    2.3. each div.row contains 8 div.checkbox

3. div.checkbox:
    3.1. depicts a single checkbox in the board
    3.2. there are a total of 64 div.checkbox in the board
    3.3. each checkbox has a defined style.backgroundColor of white or black

Your task is to:
1. Trace the path of Queen from any checkbox that is clicked by user.
2. Look at the below example to understand the path of a Queen (horizontal and vertical along with cross Diagonals).
3. Tracing the path means to set the background color property as 'red' for all the checkboxes on the path. 

Note: 
Additionaly as a bonus, you can also try to refresh the board if the user clicks on some other checkbox, and then trace path from new checkbox. (Code for this is provided in solution)
