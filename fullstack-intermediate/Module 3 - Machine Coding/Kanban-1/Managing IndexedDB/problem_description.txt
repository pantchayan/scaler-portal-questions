Problem Description: 

Managing a DB in IndexedDB

Your task is to implement the below mentioned functionality using the IndexedDB API provided by the browser.

You are provided with boilerplate HTML code for a simple form with 3 input fields and 1 button:

1. input#name : Takes in name of an Employee
2. input#add : Takes in address of an Employee
3. input#ph : Takes in phone number of an Employee
4. button : Would act as form's submit button

You need to write a program in JS such that,
1. It creates a database named 'employees' in IndexedDB, 
2. and whenever a user fills the above input fields with data and clicks on the submit button:
    2.1. It should create an Object Store named 'employee' in the database and add the employee's data as an entry to it.
    2.2. Each entry should have the following syntax:
        2.2.1  eId: Date.now(),
        2.2.2  name: name.value,
        2.2.3  address: address.value,
        2.2.4  phone: phone.value.

You need to ensure that the data being entered by the user is updated successfully following the above steps.

While submission, the test would automate the entire update process and check if the features are implemented correctly or not.
Please refer to the test case descriptions for more assistance.
