Hints:
1. Add eventListener of 'input' on div#inputs to track the inputs being made to children feilds.
2. In the call back of the above eventListener, utilise the event object to get the target Element.
3. Make use of the methods like isNan(value), Element.focus(), Element.nextElementSibling and Element.previousElementSibling on the target Element.
4. Add eventListener of 'keyup' to keep track of Backspace or Delete key being pressed.
5. Use isNan(value) to check if the input being made is a valid number or not.
