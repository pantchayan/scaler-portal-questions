Problem Description:

Write a JS program to make the given OTP input work properly.

In the Document, you have div#inputs that contains 4 input fields with 'input' class.
Here is how these inputs should work:
1. Each of the field only takes a single digit number as input.
2. When a number is entered, the focus moves to the next input field.
3. Pressing Backspace or Delete key removes the input of current field, and focus moves to the previous field.

You can utilise methods like isNan(value), Element.focus(), Element.nextElementSibling and Element.previousElementSibling to make the above mentioned features work.

Use the above information to write the entire JS program in the script.js file or script tag.
Refer to the test cases to further understand the criterias to submit the problem successfully.
