Problem Description:
Write a JS program to display information of various products from a list. 
Read the entire problem description carefully to understand the necessary details.

You are provided with: (Don't make any changes to below mentioned files)
1. index.html => containing basic document structure
2. styles.css => contains styling
3. and data.js => has a data variable that contains an Array of Objects with details of several products.

As you can access the data array, your task is to
write a program to make a product card for each of the product's object inside this array.

Algorithm:
1. Traverse through the data Array. 
2. Individually accessing each product's Object.
3. Inject relevant details like title, category, rating-count in the below mentioned HTML template to make a div.card.
4. To make the rating stars:
    4.1. Round off the rating.rate value of an object to nearest Integer
    4.2. Use this value to determine the number of empty and filled stars out of 5. (Ex: For a rating of 3/5 => 3 filled stars and 2 empty stars)
    4.3. Utilise these values in a loop to make filled and empty stars
    4.4. To make filled star symbol use a span tag with text as '&#9733;' and for empty star use '&#9734;' 
    4.5. Note that it is important to add class of 'star__filled' and 'star__notfilled' for respective cases. (To pass final test case)
    4.5. Wrap these stars (span tags) inside a div with class 'all__star'. Final result should be as shown below.
        <div class="all__star">
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__notfilled">&#9734;</span>
        </div>
5. Finally, after the div.card is ready with all the details injected, add it to div#container 

The HTML structure of a card is as follow: (Use this directly as card's HTML template)

<div class="card">
        <div class="details">
            <span class="product__name">${product.title}</span>
            <br>
            <span class="product__category">${product.category}</span>
            <div class="all__star">
                    ${HTML FOR SPANS OF STARS (as discussed in step 4 of Algorithm)}
            </div>
            <div class="rating__count">Rating Count : <span>${product.rating.count}</span></div>
        </div>
        <div class="btn">
            <button class="btn__buy">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
</div>

and object inside the data array has the following structure:
{
    id: 1,
    title: "Sample Product 1",
    price: 109.95,
    description:
      "Your perfect pack for everyday use and walks in the forest. Stash your laptop (up to 15 inches) in the padded sleeve, your everyday",
    category: "men's clothing",
    image: "https://fakestoreapi.com/img/81fPKd-2AYL._AC_SL1500_.jpg",
    rating: {
      rate: 3.9,
      count: 120,
    },
}

Use the above information to write the entire JS program in the script.js file or script tag. (below the script tag loading data.js file)
