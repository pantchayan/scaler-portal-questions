Create an HTML page that demonstrates the use of position property.

Inside the container <div>:
1. The page should display 4 boxes (divs with 'box' as class). 
2. Each with unique class 'absolute', 'relative', 'fixed', and 'static'.
3. Use CSS to set the associated position attribute respectively. 
4. Give all boxes unique top, right, left, bottom values as well.

Ex: 
<div class="box absolute"></div> 
should have position set to 'absolute'.
