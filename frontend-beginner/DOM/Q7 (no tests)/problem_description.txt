Write a JavaScript program to keep a check on the password being entered in the given input field.

Make sure that it:
1. Checks if the capslock is on or off
    1.1 If its on, it should show "caps on" on the screen, and not allow to type.
2. It should only allow to type when 'shift' key is pressed down.

i.e., make sure the user can only type when 'shift' is pressed down along with capslock as off.

NOTE :
Set display property of p element containing "caps on" warning 
as 'block' to show it, and as 'none' to hide it.
Use event.preventDefault() on the keypress event to prevent the typing in the input field.
