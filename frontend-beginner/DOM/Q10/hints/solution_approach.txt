To add functionality to a list of items, you can follow these steps. First, use querySelectorAll to get an array of all the delete buttons present in the list. Then, traverse through the array and add an event listener of 'click' to each delete button. When a delete button is clicked, you need to access the corresponding li element and set its style->display property to 'none', effectively hiding it from view.

Next, add an event listener of 'click' to the Remove All button. When this button is clicked, you need to access the ul element that contains the list and set its style->display property to 'none', hiding the entire list from view. By following these steps, you can add functionality to a list of items, allowing users to remove individual items or the entire list at once with the click of a button.
