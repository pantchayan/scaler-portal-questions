The given JS code is broken. This is because:
Even when yellow box is clicked, it is alerted that red is clicked.

Fix the code such that:
1. It alerts as 'yellow is clicked' when yellow box is clicked.
2. and alerts as 'red is clicked' when the red box is clicked.
3. A single alert is generated when any of the box is clicked.
