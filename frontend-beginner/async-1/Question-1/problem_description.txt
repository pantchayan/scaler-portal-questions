Write a function delayedSum that takes two integers, a and b, and a callback function callback. The function should use setTimeout to delay calling the callback for 1000 milliseconds and then pass the sum of a and b as an argument to the callback.

You need to implement the delayedSum function, which will introduce a delay of 1000 milliseconds using setTimeout. After the delay, it should call the provided callback function with the sum of a and b.

```javascript
function delayedSum(a, b, callback)
```

**Example**

```javascript
delayedSum(3, 5, result => {
    console.log(result); // Expected output after 1000ms: 8
});
```
