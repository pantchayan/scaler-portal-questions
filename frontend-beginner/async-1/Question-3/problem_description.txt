Write a function callbackChain that takes an array of functions as callbacks. The functions should be executed one after another in the order they are provided, with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each execution.

You need to implement the callbackChain function, which will execute a sequence of callback functions one after another with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each execution.

```javascript
function callbackChain(callbacks)
```

**Example**

```javascript
callbackChain([
    () => console.log("First callback"),
    () => console.log("Second callback"),
    () => console.log("Third callback")
]);

Output:
Prints all three messages at 500 ms delay
```
