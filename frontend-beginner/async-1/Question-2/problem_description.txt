Write a function periodicPrinter that takes a callback function and an interval timeInterval in milliseconds. 
The function should use setInterval to call the callback function every timeInterval milliseconds until explicitly stopped.

You need to implement the periodicPrinter function, which will use setInterval to repeatedly print the provided message at the specified time interval until stopped.

Note:
Please make sure to return the intervalId from the function, or else the code would never terminate from backend, resulting in failed testcase.

```javascript
function periodicPrinter(callback, timeInterval)
```

**Example**

```javascript
periodicPrinter(() => {
      console.log("This is callback");
}, 1000);

Output:
Prints "This is callback" at every 1000ms
```
