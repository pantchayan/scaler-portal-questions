To achieve the overlapping effect, follow these steps:
1. Style element1 with a specific width, height, background color, and set its position property to "absolute"
2. Use the top and left properties to position element1 20px from the top and 20px from the left of its containing element.
3. Style element2 similarly with a different width, height, background color, and set its position property to "absolute" as well.
4. Adjust the top and left properties for element2 to make it overlap element1.
