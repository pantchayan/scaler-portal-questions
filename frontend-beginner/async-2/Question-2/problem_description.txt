Write a function timeoutPromise that takes a delay time in milliseconds and returns a Promise. The Promise should resolve after the specified delay.

You need to implement the timeoutPromise function, which returns a Promise. The Promise should resolve after the specified delay time.

Note:
Please make sure to return the intervalId from the function, or else the code would never terminate from backend, resulting in failed testcase.

```javascript
function timeoutPromise(delay) 
```

```javascript

// Test Cases
timeoutPromise(2000)
    .then(result => console.log(result)) // Expected output after 2000ms: "Promise resolved after 2000 milliseconds"
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
