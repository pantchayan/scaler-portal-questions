Hints:
1. Use document.querySelectorAll('.ticket-cont') to get access to all the tickets in the document and store them in an array.
2. Traverse this array and add a 'click' eventListener to the button of each of the ticket container element in the array.
3. Get access to the: button's parent div, button and ticket's task-are using relevant selectors
4. Utilise the class of the parent div of button to find the current state
5. Use conditional statements (if-else) to write the algorithm based on states, which is mentioned in the description.
