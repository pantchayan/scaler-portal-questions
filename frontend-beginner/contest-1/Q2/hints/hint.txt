We can set the display property of the container element to "flex" to enable flexbox properties. 
We can then set the flex direction to "column" so that the header, main content, and footer sections stack vertically.

To make the header and footer sections horizontally centered, 
we can set the justify-content property of the container element to "center". 

we can set the align-items property of the container element to "center". This will align the items along the vertical axis.
