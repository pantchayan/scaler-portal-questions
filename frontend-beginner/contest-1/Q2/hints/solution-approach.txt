To create this layout, we can use the CSS flexbox properties. 
We can create a container element that will hold all the sections of the page. 
We can set the display property of this container element to "flex" to enable flexbox properties. 
We can then set the flex direction to "column" so that the header, main content, and footer sections stack vertically.
To make the header and footer sections horizontally centered, 
we can set the align-items property of the container element to "center". This will align the items along the horizontal axis. 
To make the main content section vertically centered, 
we can set the align-items property of the container element to "center". This will align the items along the vertical axis.
We can then set the height property of the header and footer sections to a fixed height and set the flex property of the main content section to "1". 
This will make the main content section take up the remaining space.
