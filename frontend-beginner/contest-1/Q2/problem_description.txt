You have been tasked with creating a web page layout using CSS flexbox. 
The layout should consist of a header section, a main content section, and a footer section. 
The header and footer sections should have a fixed height, while the main content section should take up the remaining space. 
The header and footer sections should be horizontally centered, and the main content section should be vertically centered.

How to Approach ->
Use a container element to hold all the sections of the page.
Set the display property of the container element to "flex".
Set the flex direction property of the container element to "column".
Set the justify-content property of the container element to "center".
Set the align-items property of the container element to "center".
Set the height property of the header and footer sections to a fixed height.
Set the flex property of the main content section to "1".
