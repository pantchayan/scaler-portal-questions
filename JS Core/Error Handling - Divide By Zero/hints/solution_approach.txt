Here's a step-by-step solution approach for the `divide` function with code:

1. **Define the Function**: Begin by defining the `divide` function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.

```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
    // Your code will go here
}
```

2. **Check for Division by Zero**: Inside the function, check if `b` is equal to zero. If it is, throw an error with the message "Division by zero is not allowed."

```javascript
if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error("Division by zero is not allowed.");
}
```

3. **Perform the Division Operation**: If `b` is not zero, perform the division operation `a / b` and store the result in a variable.

```javascript
const result = a / b;
```

4. **Return the Result**: Return the result of the division operation.

```javascript
return result;
```

5. **Usage Example**: In your usage examples, wrap the function call in a `try` and `catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully.

```javascript
try {
    const result = divide(10, 2); // Example division
    console.log("Result:", result);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```

Now, you have a function that performs division and handles division by zero errors gracefully. If `b` is zero, it throws an error; otherwise, it returns the result of the division.
