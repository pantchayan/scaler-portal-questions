Here are the hints tto create the `divide` function:

1. **Function Declaration**: Define the `divide` function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.

2. **Error Handling**: Check if `b` is equal to zero. If it is, you should throw an error with the message "Division by zero is not allowed."

3. **Division Operation**: If `b` is not zero, perform the division operation `a / b`.

4. **Result**: Return the result of the division operation.

5. **Usage**: In your usage examples, wrap the function call in a `try` and `catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully.
