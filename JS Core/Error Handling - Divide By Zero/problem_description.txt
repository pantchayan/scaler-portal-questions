## Problem Description 
You are building a function to perform division in JavaScript. However, you want to make sure that division by zero is handled properly. Create a function that divides two numbers and handles division by zero gracefully.

Write a JavaScript function divide that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. If the second number is zero, the function should throw an error with the message "Division by zero is not allowed."

Demonstrate the usage of the divide function by dividing two numbers, including a case where division by zero occurs.

```javascript
function divide(a, b)
```

Note that the Error message should be "Division by zero is not allowed."
and if there is no error, then the function should return result of type Number.

**Examples**

Calling the divide(a, b) function inside try and catch block with different values.

**Example 1**
```javascript
// Usage
try {
    const result = divide(10, 2);
    console.log("Result:", result); // Should print "Result: 5"
} catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```

**Output**
```
Result: 5
```

**Example 2**
```javascript
// Usage
try {
    const divisionByZero = divide(8, 0); // Division by zero
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message); // Prints: Division by zero is not allowed.
}
```

**Output**
```
Division by zero is not allowed.
```
