Sure, here are hints for implementing the `setCancellableInterval` function without providing the full code:

**Hint 1: Function Signature**
- Start by defining the function `setCancellableInterval` with two parameters: `callback` and `delay`.

**Hint 2: Use `setInterval`**
- Inside the function, use the `setInterval` function to create a recurring interval. This function takes two arguments: the `callback` function to be executed and the `delay` time in milliseconds.

**Hint 3: Return a Cancel Function**
- To enable cancellation of the interval, return a function that uses `clearInterval` to stop the interval.

**Hint 4: Usage Example**
- Provide an example of how to use the `setCancellableInterval` function. Show how to set an interval, run it for a certain duration, and then cancel it.

With these hints, you can proceed to implement the function while ensuring that it allows you to create and cancel intervals as needed.
