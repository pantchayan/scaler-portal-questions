The all function takes an array of promises as its input.

It returns a new Promise that will eventually resolve to an array of results once all the input promises have resolved or reject with an error if any of the input promises reject.

Inside the all function, it initializes an empty array called results to store the results of the promises.

It also tracks the number of promises that have completed using completedCount and the total number of promises in the input array with promisesCount.

The function then iterates through the input promises using forEach and attaches a then handler to each promise.

When a promise resolves, the result is stored in the results array at the corresponding index. The completedCount is incremented.

If the completedCount reaches the total number of promises (promisesCount), it means that all promises have resolved. In this case, the new Promise is resolved with the results array.

If any of the promises reject, the reject function is called with the error, and the new Promise is rejected with that error.
