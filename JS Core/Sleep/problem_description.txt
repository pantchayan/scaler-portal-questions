Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

## Example Usage:
```js
Input: millis = 100

Output: 100

Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.

let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() => {
  console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100
});
```

The above usage is used in the Background to test whether the function is correct or not. 
Use it as reference to submit the problem successfully.
