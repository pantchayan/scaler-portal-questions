Here are some hints for understanding and implementing the `fetchWithAutoRetry` function:

**Hint 1: Purpose of the Function**
- Understand the purpose of the function, which is to automatically retry a fetch operation when it encounters an error, up to a specified maximum number of retries.

**Hint 2: Function Signature**
- The `fetchWithAutoRetry` function takes two parameters: `fetcher`, which is a function that returns a promise (representing the fetch operation), and `maximumRetryCount`, which is the maximum number of retries allowed.

**Hint 3: Using Promises**
- The function is designed to work with promises. It starts by invoking the `fetcher` function and returns the result of the promise.

**Hint 4: Handling Errors with `.catch()`**
- If the promise returned by `fetcher` rejects (encounters an error), it is caught using the `.catch()` method. This is where the retry logic is implemented.

**Hint 5: Checking Maximum Retry Count**
- Within the `.catch()` block, check if the `maximumRetryCount` has reached zero. If it has, this means that no more retries are allowed, so the function should throw the error (`throw e`).

**Hint 6: Recursion for Retrying**
- If there are remaining retry attempts (i.e., `maximumRetryCount` is greater than zero), the function recursively calls itself with the same `fetcher` and a reduced `maximumRetryCount`.

**Hint 7: Successful Termination**
- Once the maximum number of retries is exhausted or the fetch operation succeeds, the function returns the resolved or rejected value, and the retries stop.

**Hint 8: Usage**
- To use this function, provide a `fetcher` function that performs the desired API call or fetch operation. You can set the `maximumRetryCount` to control the number of retries.

By following these hints, you can implement the `fetchWithAutoRetry` function to automatically retry a fetch operation with error handling up to the specified maximum number of retries.
