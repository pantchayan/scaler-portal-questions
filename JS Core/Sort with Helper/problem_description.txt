## Problem Description

You are given an array of objects representing books in a library. 
Each object contains details such as the author, title, and library ID of a book. 
Your task is to write a program that sorts the array in alphabetical order based on the book titles.

## Example

### Input

```javascript
[
  { author: 'Bill Gates', title: 'The Road Ahead', libraryID: 1254 },
  { author: 'Steve Jobs', title: 'Walter Isaacson', libraryID: 4264 },
  { author: 'Suzanne Collins', title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', libraryID: 3245 }
]
```

### Output

```javascript
[
  { author: 'Suzanne Collins', title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', libraryID: 3245 },
  { author: 'Bill Gates', title: 'The Road Ahead', libraryID: 1254 },
  { author: 'Steve Jobs', title: 'Walter Isaacson', libraryID: 4264 }
]
```

Note:
The `sortLibrary` function takes the `library` array as input.

// Example usage:
const library = [
  { author: 'Bill Gates', title: 'The Road Ahead', libraryID: 1254 },
  { author: 'Steve Jobs', title: 'Walter Isaacson', libraryID: 4264 },
  { author: 'Suzanne Collins', title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', libraryID: 3245 }
];

const sortedLibrary = sortLibrary(library);
console.log(sortedLibrary);
```
