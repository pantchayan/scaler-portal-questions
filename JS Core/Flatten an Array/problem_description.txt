Complete the function 'flatten(array)',

such that it takes an array and returns a single flatten array of values,
regardless of how many nested array are in the input array.

Below is an example to further understand the requirement from the question.

Example:

let array = [1,2,3,[4,5],[6,7,8,[9,10,11]]];

console.log(flatten(array));

Output:

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]


Note:
Please note that you need to create a new array which is flattened and then return it from the function.
