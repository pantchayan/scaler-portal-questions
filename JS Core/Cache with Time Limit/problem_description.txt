Write a class that allows getting and setting key-value pairs, however a time until expiration is associated with each key.

The class has three public methods:

set(key, value, duration): accepts an integer key, an integer value, and a duration in milliseconds. Once the duration has elapsed, the key should be inaccessible. The method should return true if the same un-expired key already exists and false otherwise. Both the value and duration should be overwritten if the key already exists.

get(key): if an un-expired key exists, it should return the associated value. Otherwise it should return -1.

count(): returns the count of un-expired keys.

## Example Usage:
```js
const timeLimitedCache = new TimeLimitedCache()
console.log(timeLimitedCache.set(1, 42, 1000)); // false
console.log(timeLimitedCache.get(1)) // 42
console.log(timeLimitedCache.count()) // 1
     
Output:

false
42
1
```

The above usage is used in the Background to test whether the function is correct or not. 
Use it as reference to submit the problem successfully.
