Write a pollyfill of 'map'

You need to complete the function reduce, which recieves 2 inputs:
1. 'arr'
    1.1. An array of numbers 
2. 'callback'
    2.1. A function that does takes a number as input, performs some mathematical operation on that number and returns end value.
    2.2. callback(num) returns a new number.
    2.3. For each element of the input arr, you need to store the returned number in the answer. (mapped array)

The function map(arr, callback), when called, should behave in similar fashion as inbuilt Array.prototype.map() function in JavaScript.
Refrain from using the inbuilt Array.protoype.map() function in JS, trivial test case would check for that. 


Example 1:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
callback = fn(num) => num * num;

Output: 
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Example 2:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
callback = fn(num) => num * 2;

Output: 
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
