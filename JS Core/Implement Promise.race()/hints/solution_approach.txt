Here's a detailed solution approach for implementing the `promiseRace` function:

**Step 1: Define the Function Signature**
- Start by defining the `promiseRace` function that takes an iterable of promises as its input.

```javascript
function promiseRace(iterable) {
    // Implement the function here
}
```

**Step 2: Create a New Promise**
- Inside the `promiseRace` function, create a new Promise. This Promise will resolve or reject based on the first promise from the iterable that resolves or rejects.

```javascript
function promiseRace(iterable) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Implement the function here
    });
}
```

**Step 3: Handle the Empty Iterable Case**
- Check if the input iterable is empty. If it is, reject the Promise with an appropriate message or error, as there are no promises to race.

```javascript
function promiseRace(iterable) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (iterable.length === 0) {
            reject(new Error('Empty iterable')); // Handle empty iterable case
        }
        // Continue with implementation
    });
}
```

**Step 4: Attach a `then` Handler to Each Promise**
- Iterate through the promises in the iterable using a loop or a method like `forEach`.
- For each promise, attach a `then` handler.

```javascript
function promiseRace(iterable) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (iterable.length === 0) {
            reject(new Error('Empty iterable')); // Handle empty iterable case
        }

        iterable.forEach((promise) => {
            promise.then(
                (value) => {
                    // Resolve the new Promise as soon as a promise resolves
                },
                (reason) => {
                    // Continue with error handling
                }
            );
        });
    });
}
```

**Step 5: Capture the First Resolving Promise**
- In the `then` handler, resolve the new Promise as soon as a promise from the iterable resolves. You only need the first promise to resolve to fulfill the new Promise.

```javascript
function promiseRace(iterable) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (iterable.length === 0) {
            reject(new Error('Empty iterable')); // Handle empty iterable case
        }

        iterable.forEach((promise) => {
            promise.then(
                (value) => {
                    resolve(value); // Resolve the new Promise with the value from the first resolving promise
                },
                (reason) => {
                    // Continue with error handling
                }
            );
        });
    });
}
```

**Step 6: Handle Errors**
- If all promises in the iterable reject, the `promiseRace` function will automatically reject with the reason of the first promise to reject. This behavior aligns with the standard behavior of `Promise.race`.

With this detailed approach, you can implement the `promiseRace` function, which resolves as soon as any of the input promises resolve and rejects if all input promises reject.
