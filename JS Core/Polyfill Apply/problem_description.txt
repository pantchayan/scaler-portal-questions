Write a polyfill for the apply method in JavaScript. 

You need to complete the function applyPolyfill which takes three inputs:
1. fn - A function on which apply method needs to be polyfilled.
2. context - The value of this to be used when calling the function.
3. args - An array of arguments to be passed to the function.

The function applyPolyfill(fn, context, args), when called, should behave in similar fashion as inbuilt Function.prototype.apply() function in JavaScript.
Refrain from using the inbuilt Function.protoype.apply() function in JS, trivial test case would check for that. 


Example:
function greet(country) {
  return `Hello, ${this.name}! from ${country}`;
}

const person = {
  name: 'John',
};

const result = applyPolyfill(greet, person, ['India']);
console.log(result);

Output: 
Hello, John! from India
