You are building an application where you need to perform asynchronous tasks using Promises. One of the tasks involves waiting for a specific amount of time before proceeding. To achieve this, you decide to promisify the setTimeout function.

Create a function delay that takes two arguments: milliseconds (a number) and message (a string). The function should return a Promise that resolves with the provided message after waiting for the specified number of milliseconds.

Use the delay function to create a delay of 2000 milliseconds and a message of "Task completed." Then, log the resolved message when the Promise is fulfilled.

## Example Usage:
```js
// Using the delay function
delay(2000, "Task completed")
    .then(message => {
        console.log(message); // Should print "Task completed" after a 2-second delay
    });
```

The above usage is used in the Background to test whether the function is correct or not. 
Use it as reference to submit the problem successfully.
