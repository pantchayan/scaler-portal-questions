# Title: Function for Computing Product with Different Function Call Patterns

## Description:
You are required to implement a function `f` that calculates the product of two numbers, `x` and `y`. The function should support two different function call patterns: `f(x, y)` and `f(x)(y)`. 

## Function Signature:
```javascript
function f(x: number, y: number): number
```
or
```javascript
function f(x: number): (y: number) => number
```

## Constraints:
- The function `f` should be able to handle positive and negative integer values for `x` and `y`.
- The function call patterns `f(x, y)` and `f(x)(y)` will only involve numerical inputs.

## Examples:

### Example 1:
```javascript
f(3, 4);
```
#### Output:
```
12
```

### Example 2:
```javascript
f(5)(2);
```
#### Output:
```
10
```

## Explanation:
The function `f` calculates the product of two numbers, `x` and `y`, with the option to use two different function call patterns.

In Example 1, the function is called as `f(3, 4)`, providing both `x` and `y` as arguments. The function directly calculates the product of `x` and `y` and returns the result, which is 12.

In Example 2, the function is called as `f(5)(2)`. In this case, `f(5)` returns a new function that takes the second argument, `y`, and calculates the product of `x` (which is 5) and `y` (which is 2). The result is 10.

The function `f` checks the number of arguments passed to it. If only one argument is provided, it returns a new function that stores the first argument as `x` and waits for the second argument to calculate the product. If both arguments are provided, the function immediately computes the product.

The implementation of the function `f` accounts for both function call patterns and provides the desired behavior, allowing for flexibility in how the function is called.

Note: The function `f` can be used to calculate the product of any two numerical values by using either `f(x, y)` or `f(x)(y)` syntax.
