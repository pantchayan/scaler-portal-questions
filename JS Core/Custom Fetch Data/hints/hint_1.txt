Here are hints for implementing the `fetchDataFromAPI` function:

1. **Declare an Async Function**: Begin by declaring the `fetchDataFromAPI` function as an `async` function.

2. **Use Try-Catch**: Implement a try-catch block to handle potential errors during the API request.

3. **Make an API Request**: Inside the try block, make an API request using the `customFetch` function (assuming it's defined elsewhere).

4. **Check Response**: Check the response for success using the `response.ok` property.

5. **Data Extraction**: If the response is successful, extract and return the data. Use `await` and `response.json()` for JSON responses.

6. **Error Handling**: If the response is not successful, throw an error with a message that includes the response status and status text.

7. **Catch Block**: In the catch block, handle errors by logging an error message to the console.

These hints provide a structured approach to handling both successful and error responses when fetching data from an API.
