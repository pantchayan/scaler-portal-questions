Problem Description:

You are tasked with creating a polyfill for the `Object.seal` method in JavaScript. The `Object.seal` method is a built-in function that seals an object, preventing new properties from being added and marking all existing properties as non-configurable.

Your goal is to create a function called `sealPolyfill` that emulates the functionality of `Object.seal`. The `sealPolyfill` function should be added to the `Object.prototype` object to make it accessible on all objects.

However, there are a few requirements and constraints for your implementation:

1. If the `Object.seal` method is already defined, your polyfill should not override it. You should only provide the polyfill if it doesn't exist.

2. The polyfill implementation should check if the value on which `sealPolyfill` is called is a valid object. If it's not an object or is `null`, a `TypeError` should be thrown.

3. The polyfill should iterate over all the properties of the object and mark them as non-configurable using `Object.defineProperty`. This prevents the properties from being deleted or having their attributes modified.

4. After sealing all existing properties, the polyfill should call `Object.preventExtensions` to prevent any new properties from being added to the object. This ensures that the object becomes a sealed object.

5. The sealed object should be returned by the polyfill function.

Example:

To demonstrate the usage of your `sealPolyfill` function, consider the following example:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};

console.log(Object.isSealed(obj)); // Output: false

obj.sealPolyfill();

console.log(Object.isSealed(obj)); // Output: true

obj.name = 'Jane'; // Existing property can still be modified
console.log(obj.name); // Output: Jane

obj.gender = 'Female'; // Attempt to add a new property
console.log(obj.gender); // Output: undefined (property was not added)

delete obj.age; // Attempt to delete an existing property
console.log(obj.age); // Output: 30 (property was not deleted)
```

In this example, we start with an object `obj` with two properties: `name` and `age`. Initially, the object is not sealed, as confirmed by `Object.isSealed(obj)` returning `false`.

We then call the `sealPolyfill` function on the `obj` object, which seals the object using the polyfill implementation. After sealing, `Object.isSealed(obj)` returns `true`.

Once sealed, we can still modify the value of existing properties (`obj.name = 'Jane'`), but we cannot add new properties (`obj.gender = 'Female'`) as the property addition is prevented. Similarly, attempting to delete an existing property (`delete obj.age`) does not work, as the property deletion is prevented.

Your `sealPolyfill` function should be able to replicate this behavior, allowing users to seal objects and prevent the addition of new properties while preserving the existing ones.
