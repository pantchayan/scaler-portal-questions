Write a polyfill for the bind method in JavaScript. 

You need to create a polyfill for the bind method, which allows you to set the context (the value of this) for a function and optionally preset some initial arguments.

You should implement a function customBind on the Function.prototype object. This function should accept a single argument obj, which represents the context (the value of this) to be used when calling the function.

When the customBind method is called on a function, it should return a new function that, when invoked, executes the original function with the specified context (obj) and any additional arguments passed to the bound function.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the customBind function.

Example:
function greet() {
  return 'Hello, ' + this.name + '!';
}

const person = {
  name: 'John',
};

const boundFunction = greet.customBind(person);
const result = boundFunction()
console.log(result);

Output: 
Hello, John!
