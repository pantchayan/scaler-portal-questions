1. Change color of h1 heading to 'blue' and center it horizontally to the page.
2. Change background color <p> with class 'highlight' to 'yellow'.
3. Change font size of <p> with id 'special' to 20 pixels.
4. Add a solid gray border of 10 pixels to input of having type of 'text'.
5. Change the color of <a> to 'red' when user hovers over it.
