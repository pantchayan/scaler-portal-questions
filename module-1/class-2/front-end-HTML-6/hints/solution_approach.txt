Add a <section> that will contain the 'Get in Touch' form.
Use <h1> tag to specify the heading for the section as 'Get in Touch'.
Use <form> tag to make the described form, further add three <label> tags that will enclose each text input.
For Name input, add <input> tag with attributes like type as 'text', name as 'name' and placeholder as 'Name' inside the first <label> tag, alongside a <span> containing 'Name'.
For Email input, add <input> tag with attributes like type as 'email', name as 'email' and placeholder as 'Email' inside the second <label> tag, alongside a <span> containing 'Email'.
