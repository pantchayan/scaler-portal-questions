Here are some hints to implement the functionality:

1. Use `document.querySelector` to select the relevant HTML elements that correspond to the sections you want to scroll to (e.g., s1, s2, s3).

2. Add an event listener to the `document` to listen for keydown events. You can identify the key pressed using the event object (e.g., `e.key`) to determine which action to perform.

3. For scrolling to specific sections, consider using the `scrollIntoView` method on the selected elements. You may want to wrap these operations in conditional statements to handle different key presses.

4. To scroll to the bottom of the page, you can use `window.scrollBy` with a positive value to scroll downwards.

5. To scroll to the top of the page, you can use `window.scrollBy` with a negative value to scroll upwards.

By implementing these hints, you can create a solution that responds to key presses and scrolls to the desired sections or positions on the page.
