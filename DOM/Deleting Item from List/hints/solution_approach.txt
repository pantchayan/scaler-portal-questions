Here's a step-by-step approach with code for creating a click event handler to delete list items without providing the full code:

1. **Select the Parent Element and Attach Event Listener**:
   - Select the parent `<ul>` element with the id "listToDestroy."
   - Attach a click event listener to this parent element.

```javascript
const listToDestroy = document.getElementById("listToDestroy");
listToDestroy.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    // Your code for the following steps goes here
});
```

2. **Identify the Clicked List Item**:
   - Inside the event handler, check if the clicked element (`e.target`) is an `<li>` element.

```javascript
if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    // Your code for the following steps goes here
}
```

3. **Remove the Clicked List Item**:
   - If the clicked element is an `<li>` element, you can remove it from the list by using the `remove()` method.

```javascript
if (e.target.tagName === "LI") {
    e.target.remove();
}
```

4. **Preserve Data Integrity**:
   - Ensure that the unique ID and innerText of the remaining list items are not affected by the removal of the clicked item.

By following this step-by-step approach, you can create a click event handler that deletes list items when they are clicked on while preserving the unique IDs and innerText of the remaining list items.
