Here are some hints to help you write the click event handler for deleting list items without providing the full code:

1. **Select the Parent Element**: You can start by selecting the parent element (the `<ul>` with id "listToDestroy") to attach the click event listener.

2. **Event Delegation**: Utilize event delegation to handle click events on the list items (`<li>`) and their child anchor tags (`<a>`). This way, you can handle clicks on any list item.

3. **Identify the Clicked Item**: Inside the event handler, identify the specific list item that was clicked. You can do this by inspecting the `e.target` property.

4. **Remove the Clicked Item**: Once you've identified the clicked list item, remove it from the parent element to achieve the desired functionality.

5. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Make sure that the unique ID and innerText of the remaining list items remain intact after the deletion.

By following these hints and using the provided solution as a reference, you should be able to create a click event handler that deletes list items when clicked while preserving the unique IDs and innerText of the remaining items.
