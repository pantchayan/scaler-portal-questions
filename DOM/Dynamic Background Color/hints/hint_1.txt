Here are some hints and steps to help you write the code:

1. Start by selecting the target HTML element (in this case, a `div` element) using the DOM API.

2. Attach an event listener to the window object for the "resize" event. This will allow you to respond to changes in the window size.

3. Inside the event listener, check the `window.innerWidth` to determine the width of the window after the resize event.

4. Depending on the window width, update the style of the selected `div` element to change its background color. You can use conditional statements (if-else) to handle different width ranges.

5. Make sure to consider different width ranges and choose appropriate background colors for the `div` element.

Remember to structure your code and use JavaScript functions and event handling to make it clean and maintainable.
