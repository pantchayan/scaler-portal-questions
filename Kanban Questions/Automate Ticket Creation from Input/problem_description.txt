Problem Description :

Write JS program that can create a new ticket based in the input being provided.

You have been given boilerplate HTML and CSS code that you need to study and utilise. 

.textArea-cont in the input modal would take in the content of the ticket. 
Whenever, user inputs the content and presses 'shift' key it should:

1. Create a new ticket (div.ticket-cont) with the below html sturcture:
```
    <div class="ticket-color ${ticketColor}"></div>
     <div class="ticket-id">#${id}</div>
     <div class="task-area">${ticketTask}</div>
     <div class="ticket-lock">
       <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i>
    </div>
```
2. Where out of the variables in the above boilerplate:
    2.1. ticketColor can be of any color.
    2.2. id should be from ticketID var, it should start from 0 and increment for each ticket.
    2.3. ticketTask should be the text input by user in the .textArea-cont

3. You need to add this new ticket to the div.main-cont

The boilerplate JS code contains a createTicket() function that you need to complete in order to make the feature work. 

Write the code in script.js file.
