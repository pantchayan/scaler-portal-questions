Problem Description :

You need to write JS program that:

When add button (div.add-btn) is clicked, it
makes the input modal (div.modal-cont) visible.

Visible means -> display is set to flex
Not Visible means -> display is set to none

Write the code in script.js file, and utilise the flag boolean to manage states for when the modal is visible and not visible.
