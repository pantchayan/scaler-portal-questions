Hints:

1. **Retrieve Data from Local Storage:**
   - Utilize the `localStorage.getItem` method to obtain the stored JSON string representing the tickets array.

2. **Parse JSON String into Array:**
   - Use `JSON.parse` to convert the JSON string obtained from local storage into a JavaScript array.
   - Assign the result to a variable, e.g., `ticketsArr`.

3. **Iterate Over Each Ticket Object in the Array:**
   - Utilize an array iteration method (e.g., `forEach`) to loop through each object in the `ticketsArr` array.

4. **Call `createTicket` Function for Each Ticket:**
   - Pass the relevant properties of each ticket object (e.g., `ticketTask`, `ticketColor`, `ticketID`) as arguments to the `createTicket` function.
   - Ensure that the `createTicket` function is defined elsewhere in your code to handle the creation of a ticket based on these properties.
