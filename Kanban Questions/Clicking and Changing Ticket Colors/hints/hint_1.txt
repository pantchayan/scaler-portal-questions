Here are step-by-step hints for the `handleColor` function:

1. **Select the Ticket Color Band Element:**
   - Use `querySelector` to select the element with the class `.ticket-color` within the given `ticket`.

2. **Add Event Listener for Click Event:**
   - Use `addEventListener` to attach a click event listener to the `ticketColorBand` element.

3. **Retrieve Current Ticket Color:**
   - Get the current color applied to the `ticketColorBand` element. This is typically stored as a class on the element.

4. **Find the Index of Current Color in the Colors Array:**
   - Use `findIndex` on the `colors` array to find the index of the current color.

5. **Increment the Current Color Index:**
   - Increment the index found in the previous step.

6. **Calculate the New Color Index with Modulo:**
   - Use the modulo operator (`%`) to ensure the index wraps around when it exceeds the length of the `colors` array.

7. **Retrieve the New Ticket Color:**
   - Get the new color from the `colors` array using the calculated index.

8. **Remove the Current Color Class and Add the New Color Class:**
   - Use `classList.remove` to remove the current color class, and `classList.add` to add the new color class to the `ticketColorBand` element.

By following these steps, the `handleColor` function should successfully handle the click event on the ticket color band, cycle through the colors, and update the color of the ticket accordingly.
