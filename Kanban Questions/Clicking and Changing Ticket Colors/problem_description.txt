Problem Description :

You need to write JS program, so that

When the ticket color band (div.ticket-color) is clicked:
1. It changes the color.
2. The new color should be picked from 'colors' Array.
3. The new color should be the next color mentioned in the 'colors' Array.

For example:

let colors = ["lightpink", "lightgreen", "lightblue", "black"];

According to the colors array if the color of the ticket-band is 'lightpink',
Then after clicking on it, the new color should be 'lightgreen'

4. To change the color you just need to add the color name as a class to the div.ticket-color element.
5. Make sure to remove the previous color class from the element.

For example:

<div class="ticket-color lightpink"></div>

after clicking, should become:

<div class="ticket-color lightgreen"></div>
