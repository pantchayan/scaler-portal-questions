Here are step-by-step hints for the solution code:

1. **Retrieve Ticket ID from HTML Element:**
   - Use `ticketContArr[i].querySelector(".ticket-id").innerText` to get the text content of the element with class `.ticket-id` within the `ticketContArr[i]` element.

2. **Get the Index of the Ticket in the Array:**
   - Call the `getTicketIdx` function with the retrieved ticket ID as an argument.
   - This function uses `findIndex` to locate the index of the ticket in the `ticketsArr` array based on its ID.

3. **Remove the Ticket from the Array:**
   - Use the `splice` method on `ticketsArr` to remove the ticket at the index obtained from the previous step.
   - The `splice` method modifies the array in place.

4. **Update Local Storage with Modified Array:**
   - Convert the modified `ticketsArr` array to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify`.
   - Use `localStorage.setItem` to update the "ticketsDB" item in the local storage with the updated JSON string.

The `getTicketIdx` function plays a crucial role in finding the index of the ticket based on its ID, allowing for efficient removal from the array.
